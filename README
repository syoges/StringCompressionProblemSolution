/**
 * Using no libraries, compress a nul terminated sequence of characters, in
 * place. The input characters are all in the range a-z. The input does not need
 * to be validated. The result overwrites the input and is nul terminated.
 * Return the number of characters in the result, not including the nul
 * terminator.
 *
 * The compression algorithm is: - any letter which is not repeated is
 * represented in the output by the same letter - any letter which is repeated
 * is compressed by appending it with a series of ascii numbers which represent
 * the number of repeats - any repeat bigger than 9 is represented by a series
 * of 9's and the remaining count, i.e., a repeat of 10 is represented as 91, 11
 * as 92, etc
 *
 * Examples: abab -> abab
 * aaacbbb -> a3cb3
 * addddddddddddc -> ad93c
 *
 * @param letters
 * a nul terminated sequence of the letters a-z
 * @return the length of the compressed character sequence not including the nul terminator
